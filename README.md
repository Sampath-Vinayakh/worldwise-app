# WorldWise-App

- Created a dynamic and visually engaging single-page application using React to meticulously record and showcase personal adventures.
- Enriched the application's functionality by enabling users to seamlessly add new cities they've explored. This feature was achieved through a user-friendly interface that allows clicking on the map and filling out a form.
- Proficiently utilized React Router, Reducer, and Context API to implement a structured and efficient routing system while managing application state seamlessly.
- Leveraged API integration to retrieve location information based on latitude and longitude coordinates. This information was used to generate and display a comprehensive list of cities and countries visited.
